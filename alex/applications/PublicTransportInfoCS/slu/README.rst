Building a SLU for the PTIcs domain
===================================

Available data
--------------

At this moment there we have only data which were automatically generated using handcrafted SLU (HDC SLU) parser on the
transcribed audio. In general, the quality of the automatic annotation is very good.

The data can be prepared using the ``prapare_data.py`` script. It assumes that there exist the ``indomain_data`` directory
with links to directories with ``asr_transcribed.xml`` files. Then it uses these files to extract transcriptions
and generate automatic transcriptions using the PTICSHDCSLU parser from the ``hdc_slu.py`` file.

The script generates the following files:

- ``*.trn``: contains manual transcriptions
- ``*.trn.hdc.sem``: contains automatic annotation from transcriptions using handcrafted SLU
- ``*.asr``: contains ASR 1-best results
- ``*.asr.hdc.sem``: contains automatic annotation from 1-best ASR using handcrafted SLU
- ``*.nbl``: contains ASR N-best results
- ``*.nbl.hdc.sem``: contains automatic annotation from n-best ASR using handcrafted SLU


Future work
-----------

- Fix VHUB unicode problem.
- Ask a question after hangup by DM
- When happens call disconnect do not close session.xml. Only when new session is created, the old is closed.
- Enable new trained SLU.
- Keep CFGs for HDC SLU.
- Where to store big SLU models.
- It looks like that the CLDB cannot abstract "sedmnáct nunla nula"
- The ``prepare_data.py`` will have to use ASR, NBLIST, and CONFNET data generated by the latest ASR system instead of the
  logged ASR results because the ASR can change over time.
- Condition the SLU DialogueActItem decoding on the previous system dialogue act.


Evaluation
----------

Evaluation of ASR from the call logs files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The current ASR performance computed on from the call logs is as follows:
::

    Ref: all.trn
    Tst: all.asr
    |==============================================================================================|
    |            | # Sentences  |  # Words  |   Corr   |   Sub    |   Del    |   Ins    |   Err    |
    |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | Sum/Avg    |     1177     |   3108    |  58.46   |  16.86   |  24.68   |   0.55   |  42.08   |
    |==============================================================================================|

The used ASR decoder for the first 1177 sentences is Google.

Evaluation of the min number of feature counts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Probably due to small amount of data (cca 900 utterances), it is beneficial to use features which appeared in
the training data only two times.


Estimating accuracy of the HDC SLU on ASR 1-best hypothesis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the ``train.trn.hdc.sem`` and ``train.asr.hdc.sem``, the following results were obtained:

If the automatic annotations were correct, we could conclude that the F-measure of the HDC SLU parser on 1-best
results is about 51 %.

This is confusing as it looks like that the decoding from n-best lists gives worse results when compared to decoding from
1-best ASR hypothesis.

Evaluation of TRN model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The TRN model is trained on transcriptions and evaluated on both transcriptions and the ASR output from dev and test data.

::

    DEV and TEST data size is about 120 utterances.

    TRN model on TRN DEV data

    Total precision:  88.89
    Total recall:     88.89
    Total F-measure:  88.89

    TRN model on TRN TEST data

    Total precision:  91.41
    Total recall:     92.13
    Total F-measure:  91.76

    TRN model on ASR DEV data

    Total precision:  44.54
    Total recall:     42.06
    Total F-measure:  43.27

    TRN model on ASR TEST data

    Total precision:  48.33
    Total recall:     45.67
    Total F-measure:  46.96

One can see that the performance of the TRN model on TRN dev and test data is **NOT** 100 % perfect. This is probably due to
the mismatch between the train, dev, and test data sets. Once more training data will be available, we can expect better
results.


Evaluation of ASR model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ASR model is trained on transcriptions and evaluated on both transcriptions and the ASR output from dev and test data.

::

    ASR model on TRN DEV data

    Total precision:  81.75
    Total recall:     81.75
    Total F-measure:  81.75

    ASR model on TRN TEST data

    Total precision:  77.60
    Total recall:     76.38
    Total F-measure:  76.98

    ASR model on ASR DEV data

    Total precision:  59.20
    Total recall:     58.73
    Total F-measure:  58.96

    ASR model on ASR TEST data

    Total precision:  59.52
    Total recall:     59.06
    Total F-measure:  59.29

On can see that the ASR model scores worse on the TRN DEV and TRN TEST data when compared to the TRN model. This is
expected result. The good thing is that the **ASR model scores significantly better** on the ASR DEV and ASR TEST data when
compared to *the TRN model*. Even more, the the **ASR model scores significantly better** on the ASR DEV and ASR TEST data when
compared to *the HDC SLU parser* when evaluated on the ASR data. The improvement is about 8 % in F-measure (absolute).

This shows that SLU trained on the ASR data sets can be beneficial.

Evaluation of NBL model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The NBL model is trained on transcriptions and evaluated on both transcriptions and the NBL output from dev and test data.

::

    NBL model on TRN DEV data

    Total precision:  59.52
    Total recall:     59.52
    Total F-measure:  59.52

    NBL model on TRN TEST data

    Total precision:  63.28
    Total recall:     63.78
    Total F-measure:  63.53

One can see that using nblists even from Google ASR can help; though only a little. When more data will be available,
more test and more feature engineering can be done. However, we are more interested in extracting features from lattices
or confusion networks. However, for this we have to wait for working decoder generating lattices. The OpenJulius decoder
is not a suitable as it crashes unexpectedly and cannot be used in a real system.
